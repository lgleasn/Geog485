	<h1>Lab Assignment / Deep Dive 4</h1>
	<h3>In your milestone for Week 4 you built a styled Google Maps base map for a particular region of interest. For this deep dive assignment create a new free-standing web page that includes a brief description of the topical focus of your mapper.</h3>

	<p>I want to show some of the areas that we are considering for our annual vacation</p>
	<p>I picked the San Juan Capistrano since that is the area we chose to visit this year.
<p>I want to show some of the areas that we plan to visit - including the hotel, restaurant, and point of interest</p>
