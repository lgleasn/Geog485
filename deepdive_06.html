		<h2>Question 1</h2>
What request type is common across all three (WMS, WFS, WCS) OGC web services that we have learned about? - GetCapabilities
<p>output Format type - .tif</p>
Answer the following questions about a WMS GetCapabilities request
<h2>Question 2</h2>
What are the required parameters, and what do they represent? What is returned in response to a WMS GetCapabilities request? 
Answer the following questions about a WMS GetMap request</h2>
<h2>Question 3</h2>
What are the required parameters, and what do they represent? What is returned in response to a WMS GetMap request? 
Required parameters - Request version, request name, Layers list, Styles=style_list, Spatial Reference System; BBox; Width, Height; output format
Return - image
What is the significance of transparency in WMS requests?   - You might want the background to be transparent in order to apply layers.
<h2>Question 4</h2>
What OGC request would you use to inform the configuration of a client application (like ArcGIS) about an OGC service that you want to add layers from?


<h2>Question 5</h2>
Which OGC request would you submit under the following circumstances (include both the service type [e.g. WMS, WFS, WCS], and the request [e.g. GetMap, GetCapabilities, GetCoverage, etc.] in your answer)
You want a map image representing three layers of data in a single JPEG for a specified area of interest. You want to retrieve data representing geometries and associated attributes for a road network, with the returned data in GML. 
You want to retrieve data representing a digital elevation model (a raster dataset) in the form of a GeoTIFF.
<h2>Question 6</h2> 
What are the EPSG codes of the following Spatial Reference Systems
WGS 84 (Geodetic CRS [geographic 2d]) - 4326
NAD83 / UTM zone 13N  - 26913
NAD27 / UTM zone 13N - 26713


<h2>Question 7</h2>
Use the cs2cs utility to convert the following WGS84 Geographic Coordinates into UTM Zone 13, NAD83 coordinates. Include your cs2cs command and output in your writeup.
35°14′19.29″ N, 107°36′30.67″ W (Mount Taylor Summit) 34°16′40.34″ N, 103°19′28.49″ W (Blackwater Draw) 

<h2>Question 8</h2>
Retrieve the GetCapabilities XML response from the following WMS, and answer the following questions.

What is the Title of the service?	<Title>rgis Dataset (715663ba-c1c3-414c-84a7-c671526f8316)</Title>
Who is the Contact Person for questions about the service? <ContactPerson>GStore Support</ContactPerson>
What are the available image formats for the GetMap request for this service? 
<li><Format>image/png</Format></li>

<Format>image/gif</Format>

<Format>image/jpeg</Format>

<Format>image/png; mode=8bit</Format>

<Format>image/tiff</Format>

What are the SRS/CRS’s for which layers from this service are available (remember that nested layers inherit the SRS/CRS of their parent layers).
SRS>EPSG:4269</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:4326</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:4267</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:26913</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:26912</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:26914</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:26713</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:26712</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:26714</SRS>

<SRS>EPSG:3857</SRS>

<h2>Question 9</h2>
Formulate a GetMap request for the “tl_2010_35_bg10” layer from this service, for a 500x500 pixel map image that is 0.05-degrees wide and 0.05-degrees high, 
with the SW corner of the map image located at 35°N and -106°45'E. Include in your write-up the complete GetMap request and the returned map image.
